# SQL-Challenge-Employee-Tracker

Creating a Content Management System to manage employee data using a MySQL database, Node.js and Inquirer.

Created a schema.sql using MySQL workbench. 

Created a app.js for the purpose of creating departments, viewing roles, viewing employees, adding roles, adding employees and updating employees.

Created Operations JS files to separate out the execution of functions by department, role and employee. 

Created a connect JS file to manage the connection with the MySQL database. 

<!-- Roadblock -->
I have installed the NPM packages including MySQL2. 
When I run node app.js there is an error in my department.js which I can't seem to get past. 

Link to video walk through which still has errors preventing it to run properly: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IZgqf7YrBSrtvbAtIvsFYnId2fJUnJsW/view
